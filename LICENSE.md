## The Full Standard License

#### Basics

1.  The Standard License grants you a non-exclusive right to make use of Theme you have purchased.
2.  You are licensed to use the Item to create one End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the End Product can be distributed for Free.
3.  _You can…_
    1.  Create one End Product for a client, transfer that End Product to your client, charge them for your services. The license is then transferred to the client.
    2.  Make unlimited copies of the single End Product as long as the End Product is distributed for free
    3.  Modify the Theme or combine the Theme with other works to make a derivative one. The result is subject to this license. This clause applies to extracting single components from the Theme and using it in derivative works as well.
4.  _You cannot…_
    1.  Sell the End Product except to one client.
    2.  Re-distribute the Theme’s source, modified or not, even if the Theme is modified.
    3.  Use the Theme in any application allowing an End User to customize the Theme, like “build it yourself” or “theme generators”.
    4.  Allow the End User of the End Product to access the Theme’s source and use it separately from the End Product.
5.  If a Theme contains code, images, or content sourced from elsewhere under a different license, that item retains its original license. The license for the code, images, or content will be noted by the Theme author. You are responsible for adhering to the original license or clearing it with the author of the code, image, or content.
6.  This license can be terminated if you breach it and you lose the right to distribute the End Product until the Theme has been fully removed from the End Product.
