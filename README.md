### Who Am I?
I am a game developer and a professional minecraft developer and builder. Starting off my developmeny career at 14 years old I have slowly learned new techniques and ways to display and create new work with one of a kind content. I am currently working on a video game developed using unreal engine 4 and am continsouly building maps for fellow minecraft creators and influencers.

## Why Sponsor Me?
As you may know, server and development costs are very high when it comes to minecraft server development and team build servers. Alongside this, creating and or purchasing custom game assets can become very expensive as I have to live in life as well! Sponsorships would be greatly appreciated in order for me to be able to continue to run these types of services as I have drawn a deficit in income to hardware costs.
